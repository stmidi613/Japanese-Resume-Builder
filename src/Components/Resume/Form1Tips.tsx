          The photo should be 3cm X 4cm which the app does for you. You should
          look professional in a black suit, white shirt, and tie. To size your
          photo you can use software like Photoshop, Figma, or web apps.

        <h2 className="tips-h2">Name:</h2>
        <p className="text-left">
          In Japan the format for the name is "Last Name ãƒ» First Name Middle
          Name". Notice that a comma is not used but a dot is. For the name in
          Furigana you can use Katakana and Google Translate. For the large name
          section you can use English characters for western names or Kanji.

        <h2 className="tips-h2">Date of Birth:</h2>
        <p className="text-left">
          Please fill out each section of the date. The date of birth is
          converted into the Japanese year and stating your age on the resume is
          normal in Japanese society. Japanese people will ask you how old you
          are and it is not impolite in their culture.

        <h2 className="tips-h2">Address:</h2>
        <p className="text-left">
          Please fill out the Furigana address the best you can. Google
          Translate helps. It is also better to use as much Japanese as
          possible.
